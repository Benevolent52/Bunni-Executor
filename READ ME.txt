        BUNNI EXECUTOR 🐰
==============================

Thanks for downloading Bunni,

Our team is constantly working to bring you a smooth, clean, and malware-free experience.  
Bunni is built for scripters, tinkerers, and anyone who wants to push Roblox beyond its limits.

---

📦 INSTALLATION

1. Run **BunniSetup.exe** (Right-click > "Run as administrator" is recommended).
2. ⚠️ It’s **normal if it takes a little time** to start or install.  
   The setup is checking dependencies and preparing the injection environment.
3. Once installed, launch **Bunni.exe** to start injecting into Roblox.

---

❗ TIPS

- Temporarily disable your antivirus if Bunni gets blocked.  
  *(False positives are common with DLL injection — Bunni contains **no malware**.)*
- Make sure **Roblox is open** before you hit "Inject".
- Drop your custom Lua scripts into the **scripts/** folder.
- If the executor isn't launching, you should restart your computer, and retry executing Setup.

❗ PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH

- Do not touch files that are apart of this executor, by doing this
you could break the "undetectable" feature. Please ! Thank you !
